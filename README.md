# Python Exam Project - Gas Station

## Overview
This project is a Python-based simulation of a gas station management system. It demonstrates the use of object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts for handling fuel inventory, customer transactions, and report generation.

## Features
- Manage different types of fuel and stock levels.
- Generate detailed reports on fuel usage and sales.
- Input validation and error handling.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/aykhan019/Python_ExamProject
  ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
  ```bash
  cd Python_ExamProject
  ```
3. Run the main script:
  ```bash
  python main.py
  ```

## Usage
- The system allows users to manage a gas station, keeping track of fuel types, fuel levels, and transactions.
- Input validation ensures that only correct data is entered, while reports provide insights into fuel consumption and financials.
